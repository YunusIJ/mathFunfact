         *Overview of the Application*

The Number Properties API is a straightforward and efficient API designed to classify numbers based on their mathematical properties and provide an interesting fact about the number. It takes a number as input and returns information on whether the number is prime, perfect, or an Armstrong number, along with its digit sum and parity (odd/even). Additionally, it fetches a fun fact about the number from an external API.

            *Features*
Prime Number Check: Determines if a number is prime.

Perfect Number Check: Identifies if a number is perfect.

Armstrong Number Check: Checks if a number is an Armstrong number.

Digit Sum Calculation: Calculates the sum of the digits of the number.

Parity Classification: Classifies the number as odd or even.

Fun Fact Retrieval: Fetches a fun fact about the number from the Numbers API.

The application consists of several key components:

app.js: The main entry point of the application where the server is configured and started.

router.js: Handles routing and defines the endpoints.

mainHandler.js: Contains the logic to process requests and generate responses.

helpers.js: Provides utility functions to determine number properties.

                *Setting Up the Server*
The app.js file is responsible for setting up the Express server and loading environment variables.
In the app.js, we import necessary modules, configure environment variables, and set up middleware. The server listens on a specified port and responds to requests at the root endpoint.

                *Routing and Request Handling*
The router.js file defines the routes and associates them with the appropriate handlers. Here, we define a route that uses the numberHandler function from mathHandler.js to process requests.


       *Processing Requests in mathHandler.js*
The mathHandler.js file contains the logic to handle incoming requests, validate input, and generate responses. This function validates the input, fetches a fun fact from an external API, and uses helper functions to determine the properties of the number.


           *Utility Functions in helpers.js*
The helpers.js file contains several utility functions to determine number properties. These functions check if a number is prime, perfect, or Armstrong, calculate the sum of its digits, and determine if it is odd or even.


       *How It Works*
1. The API receives a number as input.

2. It validates the input to ensure it is a valid integer.

3. It calculates the number's properties (prime, perfect, Armstrong, etc.).

4. It fetches a fun fact from the Numbers API.

5. The response is returned in a structured JSON format.
